  "summary": [
    "I'm a full-stack developer and product builder with a passion for turning complex challenges into elegant, impactful solutions. My journey in technology is driven by a desire to build things that matter, from founding a **NASSCOM-funded tech startup incubated at IIIT Bangalore** to architecting a diverse range of applications.",
    "My toolkit is a blend of creativity and engineering. I leverage **React, Next.js, and Flutter** for dynamic user interfaces, build robust backend systems with **Node.js and Python**, and explore the frontiers of AI with **TensorFlow and LLMs**. This versatility allows me to not just write code, but to design, manage, and deliver complete products from concept to launch.",
    "Beyond the code, I thrive in collaborative environments, a passion sharpened by competing in—and winning—multiple hackathons. I'm always excited to connect with fellow innovators and explore new challenges."
